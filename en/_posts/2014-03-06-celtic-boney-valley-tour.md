I was supposed to wake up 6am. I needed to arrive in front of my school at quarter to eight to meet my classmates, teachers and go to this tour. But something wrong should have happened because I woke up with no help of my clock alarm. When I realised, my phone was in my hands. I couldn't remember why, but I knew it wasn't a good signal. Immediately I turned the screen on to check the time and I confirm what I’ve already known: I was very late!

I was one hour late and I only had 45 minutes to arrive on the time scheduled and from home to school, I usually take 35 minutes. For a moment I thought of give up. I verified the bus realtime table and there was a bus passing in 11 minutes. Time to be quick! I already wore most part of the clothes to sleep in this cold weather… But I needed more! So I brushed quickly my teeth, took my glasses, backpack (filled with delicious tuna cheese sandwiches) I ran to the bus stop. Happy days, I arrived in the school exactly 7:45am :D. I met the horses and we went out!

The first place we went is called ‘Hill of Tara’, located in count Meath. It’s a archeological complex that contains different ancient monuments. There we can see ‘Lia Fáil’, the stone where High Kings of Ireland were crowned. The legend says that the stone will shout when the true King stand on it. I tried to be discovered as King, but I didn’t have much success.

Next place was Trim Castle. This castle was built more than 800 years ago. It was scenario for Braveheart by Mel Gibson. We were led by a tour guide who explained lots of details about the castle story. To be honest, I couldn’t understand much of what him said. I got a few stories and all of them were very brutal (Vikings and English!). Now it’s ok, happy days!

Loughcrew Passage Tomb was the next place we visited. Green and great Irish hills with an amazing landscape. This tomb dates back from about 3300 B.C. Older than Egypt pyramids! Inside the tombs you can see carvings and human bones. I wouldn’t say it isn’t weird being in a place with more than 3000 years… It is.

Ruins of Monasterboice is an old monastic settlement and it dates back to the 5th century. There are a cemetery of priests, a big old tower and two very old celtic crosses. The celtic cross was a way to introduce the christian to celtic people trying to not scary them with a totally different believe. It seems to have worked.

Next stop was in Drogheda. It’s an industrial and port town located in count Louth. I would like remembering why I didn’t take pictures of the town, but ok. I took some of the church (blah).

5pm we met in the bus to go back back Dublin. It was a very nice trip. Ireland is amazing!

Cheers!
