I’m a little bit paranoid about writing. When I’m writing in portuguese I review my texts all the time. I’m not good in portuguese grammar, but it’s my mother language - most of the time I can realize what is wrong or not.
Now, I think it’s time to give my English a chance. Unlike writing in portuguese, this time I’m using orthographical corrector. Other good ‘friend’ that often helps me and I really love it is <a href="http://linguee.com.br">linguee.com</a>. Ok, no more <i>blablabla</i> (Is it universal? I think so…), let’s see what I’ve been doing here in Ireland.

## // Routine control

Start of the year sometimes is a weird moment for unorganised people. We try to make reflections and promises to improve during the year. I’ve done the same. It started last year when, during a conversation class. A friend of mine - Optimistic Omar, a very smart Venezuelan guy - told me he always plans what he needs to do for all the next week. It seemed nice for me: you can plan all your week and on the next ‘planning day’ you can improve what wasn’t so good on the last planning. After that, on 31st December 2013, I watched a <a href="https://www.eventials.com/locaweb/startups-software/">talk</a> about software made by <a href="https://twitter.com/AkitaOnRails">Fábio Akita</a>. During a long time in this talk, he focus on **plannings** and how important it is, not necessarily about software, in general - *life*, for example. I got excited with that so I decided starting to do the same: **plan my weeks**.

After one month and a half, I’m satisfied. I could see some results - not big results, but It’s fine. Now I can  split my time to do lots of things I wanted to do: study English, play the bass, work, study for my work, read books, *drink water*, go sleeping at a good time (maximum 00:00) etc. I’ve been trying to improve this routine *week by week* and there’s an important thing I’m not doing but I know I need to fix as soon as possible: doing a kind of physical exercise. Yeah, I’ll fix this in my routine but these days are so cold <span class="eyes">:</span><span class="tong">|</span><span class="beard">~</span>.

## // English Learning

It’s not that fantasy we (exchange students) usually think before come to a country whose native language is English. I’m not going to speak a good English in six months, now I know that <span class="eyes">:</span><span class="tong">)</span><span class="beard">~</span>. But OK, I’m not worried about this… I’ll continue my English studies for a *looong* time and probably I’ll learn more everyday I study. I’m a software developer, am I talking about study for a long time? Tell me about it…

I can practice talking with Kevin in my job - and fortunately, he seems more like a friend than a boss. I’m sure the mobstats guys will agree with that.

I can practise a lot in school and it’s nice! When I arrived there, there were ten or eleven people in my class. 1 Venezuelan and everyone else were Brazilian. All of them are nice, but for practise English, it didn’t help. Now we have a good mix of nationalities: Brazilians, Venezuelan, French, Chinese, Bulgarian… All of them are nice as well.

Last but not least, I can practise with my friends! I have met really nice guys here. I want to send a <i>’Salve’</i> for all these mates! Pedro Piragibe, Pedro Blue, Carmem, Omar, Crispi, Mariana, Taye, Augusto, Dyllan… Hahahah, you’re **awesome**.

## // Temple Bar TradFest 2014

From 22nd to 26th January happened the ’Temple Bar TradFest’. It’s a traditional event in Dublin and I had the opportunity to see nice music concerts for free. I went to three concerts of well-known Irish bands: ‘The Dublin Legends’ (guys who continues to do an excellent work maintaing the legacy of ‘The Dubliners’); The Fureys, an traditional band in a longtime career and very experienced musicians; and Bagattele, other old band with great musicians and owners of the successful song ‘Summer in Dublin’. It was nice, drink some pints while listening great Irish bands in traditional Irish pubs.

## // Visa

I got visa last week, finally! Hahah, I received a period of three months to resolve it but I only got my visa in three months and one day. But ok, now I have it and I won’t have problems about that.

## // Brazilians getting happy

The first time seeing snow we’ll never forget! It was awesome!! All the students (at least the brazilian ones) came to outside school to feel the snow and take some pictures. We didn’t have BIG snowflakes, but it doesn’t matter, we all got very excited. :D

## // Finishing

This is what happened in some days here. As I said, I’m trying to follow my routine and make things I planned before came to Ireland happen. Sorry for my basic English and for my mistakes. This is what I can do until this moment. Below, I’ve put some photos from here. Bye <span class="eyes">:</span><span class="tong">)</span>

Android KitKat has new features do edit photos. I liked it! It's nice to play with. I've used a manual filter feature to do these following ones.
